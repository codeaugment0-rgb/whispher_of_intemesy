- ✅ Improved responsive design without breaking functionality

### 3. JavaScript Integration
- ✅ Fixed JavaScript to match template class names
- ✅ Added fallback simple pagination system
- ✅ Improved AJAX response handling

### 4. CSS Styling
- ✅ Created dedicated pagination.css with proper styling
- ✅ Added mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Implemented proper touch targets (44px minimum)
- ✅ Added loading states and animations

## How to Test

### 1. Basic Functionality
1. Navigate to the scenes list page
2. Click on page numbers - should navigate to that page
3. Use Previous/Next buttons
4. Try First/Last page buttons (when available)

### 2. Page Size Selector
1. Change the "Items per page" dropdown
2. Should reload with new page size and reset to page 1

### 3. Jump to Page
1. Enter a page number in the "Go to page" input
2. Click "Go" button or press Enter
3. Should navigate to that page

### 4. Keyboard Navigation
1. Use arrow keys (← →) to navigate pages
2. Use Home key to go to first page
3. Use End key to go to last page

### 5. Mobile Responsiveness
1. Test on mobile device or resize browser window
2. Buttons should be touch-friendly (44px minimum)
3. Text should be readable and properly sized
4. Layout should adapt to small screens

### 6. AJAX vs Fallback
1. With JavaScript enabled: Should use AJAX loading
2. With JavaScript disabled: Should use standard page navigation
3. Both should work seamlessly
