# Correction Summary

## Issue Clarification
The user wanted to remove the count from the **favorites button on the scene detail page**, not the navbar. I had initially misunderstood and removed it from the navbar.

## Corrections Made

### ✅ **Removed Count from Scene Detail Page Favorites Button**
- **File**: `scenes_project/scenes_app/templates/scene_detail.html`
- **Change**: Removed the `<span id="favorite-count">` element that displayed `({{ favorite_count }})`
- **Result**: The favorites button on scene detail pages now shows just "Add to Favorites" or "Remove from Favorites" without the count

### ✅ **Restored Navbar Favorites Count**
- **File**: `scenes_project/scenes_app/templates/base.html`
- **Change**: Restored the `<span id="nav-favorite-count">` element in the navbar
- **Result**: The navbar favorites button still shows the count badge as intended

### ✅ **Updated JavaScript**
- **File**: `scenes_project/scenes_app/static/js/main.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed code that updates favorite count on scene detail page
  - Restored navbar favorite count functionality
  - Maintained all other features (copy random scene, delete buttons)
